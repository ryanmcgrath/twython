This module contains Warning classes for Twython to specifically
alert the user about.

This mainly is because Python 2.7 > mutes DeprecationWarning and when
we deprecate a method or variable in Twython, we want to use to see
the Warning but don't want ALL DeprecationWarnings to appear,
only TwythonDeprecationWarnings.

    Python 2.7 > ignores DeprecationWarning so we want to specifcally bubble up ONLY Twython Deprecation Warnings
